00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:04,096
Read and listen to two women discussing family photos

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:07,424
Who's your brother

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,496
No that's my brother-in-law Matthew

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:13,312
He's married to my older sister Alexa

5
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,360
And this is their son Aiden

6
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,640
He's adopted

7
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,200
Do they have any other children

8
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,528
No just the one he's an only child

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,856
Looks like they're having a great time in New York

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,160
Actually they live there

11
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,184
They do

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,208
Wow

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,256
How often do you see them

14
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,072
We get together about twice a year

15
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,888
And what about these kids

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,936
They're my younger sisters

17
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:44,800
Ariana's the girl and these are her little brothers Cole and Casey

18
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,616
Cole and Casey look so much alike

19
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,896
Are they twins

20
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,432
They are

21
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:54,272
They all live in Vancouver but we keep in touch on the internet
